# vertex_characterization

Our goal is to study and distinguish three types of nodes in a network:

-*No cluster*: Nodes belonging to no particular community/cluster (these two words will be used interchangeably).

-*In cluster*: Nodes belonging to "a flat" cluster. There are no "clusters within" this cluster.

-*In hierarchical cluster*: Nodes belonging to a cluster which has sub-clusters within.

For now, we attempt to create a random model of a network with these three types of vertices
